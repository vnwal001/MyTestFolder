## PART 1

### A) DATA MANIPULATION

##### To prepare my data for use I did the following:
- The original file was in xls format, I created a new csv file to place my data
- I copied over the values of the only data I needed for my analysis, I copied the state population data for just 1970, 1985, 1995 and 2009.
- I for the specified years, if they had both and April and July data, I picked the July data for that year because most years data were collected in July. I only took the April data if there was not July available
- I rename the Years column to just the Year and removed the month. 

### B) TABLE 12

#### 1) BOXPLOT : Show the distributions of the population of all states in 1970, 1985, 1995, and 2009. This should result in 4 separate boxplot glyphs in a single chart

<img src="https://github.com/vnwal001/MyTestFolder/blob/main/h1.png" alt="Boxplot of Population distribution For 50 States for 1970, 1985, 1995, and 2009" width="1189" height="590">

- *Description of the chart and how is was created (explain the code you used and include code snippets)*
- Answer: Code Snippet and Explanation

```
#pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
#matplotlib.pyplot: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
#seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive graphics.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Step 1: Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vnwal001/MyTestFolder/refs/heads/main/population4.csv')


# Step 2: Extract relevant columns (removing unnecessary columns)
years = ['1970', '1985', '1995', '2009']
pop_data = data[['State'] + years]  # Only keep State and relevant year columns

# Step 3: Melt the DataFrame to long format
pop_melted = pop_data.melt(id_vars=['State'], value_vars=years, var_name='Year', value_name='Population')

# Convert Population to numeric (if not already)
pop_melted['Population'] = pd.to_numeric(pop_melted['Population'], errors='coerce')

# Step 4: Exclude Washington, D.C.
pop_melted = pop_melted[pop_melted['State'] != 'District of Columbia']

# Step 5: Create the boxplots
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Year', y='Population', data=pop_melted)

# Set the y-axis to start from 0
plt.ylim(0, pop_melted['Population'].max() * 1.1)  # Adjust the upper limit as needed

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Population Distribution by State for Selected Years (Excluding D.C.)')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Population In Thousands')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
- Explanation
  ```
  Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of the population data for each year, indicating where the middle 50% of data lies.
  The line inside each box represents the median population.
  Whiskers extend to show the range of the data (excluding outliers).
  Outliers are plotted as individual points outside the whiskers
   ```
  
- *Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of distribution chart idiom for showing these distributions (talk specifically about these distributions, not just their advantages and disadvantages in general)*
- Answer:
```
Advantages
1) This Boxplots have provide a concise summary of the dataset by displaying the median, quartiles, and potential outliers, making it easy to grasp the distribution characteristics at a glance.
2) It has helped to facilitate comparisons between different categories (in this case, different years), highlighting differences in central tendency and variability.
3) This Boxplot has  effectively identified outliers, which can be crucial for understanding anomalies in the data.

Disadvantages
1) It does convey information about the number of data points or the specific values
2) In this box plot you cannot clearly tell if outlier points overlap
```

- *Name 1-2 simple observations you can draw from each chart*
- Answer:
- 1) Every year compared had state population outliers
- 2) The median population does not change by so much, yes there is a steady increase but not by much across the years compared. 




#### 2) Histogram: Show the distribution of the population of all states in one of the years (your chart title must indicate which year) your histogram should use a reasonable bin size for the data

<img src="https://github.com/vnwal001/MyTestFolder/blob/main/h2.png" alt="Histogram of Population distribution For 50 States for 2009" width="1189" height="590">


- *Description of the chart and how is was created (explain the code you used and include code snippets)*
- Answer: Code Snippet and Explanation

```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Step 1: Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vnwal001/MyTestFolder/refs/heads/main/population4.csv')

# Step 2: Extract relevant columns
year = '2009'  # Change to the desired year
pop_data = data[['State', year]]

# Step 3: Filter out Washington D.C.
pop_data = pop_data[pop_data['State'] != 'District of Columbia']

# Step 4: Convert the Population to numeric (if not already)
pop_data[year] = pd.to_numeric(pop_data[year], errors='coerce')

# Step 5: Create the histogram using Seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.histplot(pop_data[year].dropna(), bins=15, color='skyblue', kde=True)

# Add titles and labels
plt.title(f'Population Distribution of States in {year} (Excluding D.C.)')
plt.xlabel('Population In Thousands')
plt.ylabel('Number of States')
plt.grid(axis='y')

# Show the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

- Explanation
  ```
1) The resulting histogram displays the distribution of state populations for the year 2009. X-Axis (Population in Thousands) represents the population of the states, segmented into bins. Y-Axis (Number of States)
represents the number of states that fall within each population bin.
2) The histogram visualizes how the populations of the states are distributed, allowing for quick identification of population ranges where most states fall. The overlayed KDE provides a smooth estimate of the population density
.
  ```

- *Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of distribution chart idiom for showing these distributions (talk specifically about these distributions, not just their advantages and disadvantages in general)*
- Answer:
```

```
Advantages 

1) The histogram effectively displays how state populations are distributed across a range, allowing for quick insights into the overall population distribution.
Exclusion of D.C.:

2) By excluding Washington, D.C., the histogram focuses solely on the states, which provides a clearer understanding of state populations without the outlier effect of the capital.
Kernel Density Estimate (KDE):

3) The inclusion of a KDE overlay smooths the distribution, helping to highlight underlying trends and patterns.

Disadvantages

1) Like all histograms, this one aggregates data into bins, which means that individual variations within those bins are not visible. This could mask important insights.

2) Viewers might misinterpret the distribution if they are not aware of the effects of binning and KDE smoothing, leading to incorrect assumptions about the data's underlying distribution.

3) While the KDE adds useful information, it could also create confusion if the audience misinterprets it as a distinct data series rather than a smoothed estimate of the histogram.
   
4) This histogram represents only the year 2009. It doesnâ€™t allow for comparisons across multiple years or an understanding of population trends over time, limiting its analytical depth.
   
```
- *Name 1-2 simple observations you can draw from each chart*
- Answer:
  1) I observed that about 25 states have populations clustered around the first bin which is between 4 million and 5 million people
  2) I observed that this is a rightly skewed distribution. A right-skewed distribution often indicates the presence of outliers or extreme values on the high end of the scale.
 
 

#### 3) eCDF: Show the distributions of the population of all states in two of the years (your legend must indicate which years)


<img src="https://github.com/vnwal001/MyTestFolder/blob/main/h3.png" alt="eCDF Distributions of the population of all states for 1995 and 2009" width="989" height="590">

- *Description of the chart and how is was created (explain the code you used and include code snippets)*
- Answer: Code Snippet and Explanation

```
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vnwal001/MyTestFolder/refs/heads/main/population4.csv')

# Step 2: Exclude Washington D.C.
data = data[data['State'] != 'District of Columbia']

# Step 3: Extract population data for the years 1995 and 2009
population_1995 = pd.to_numeric(data['1995'], errors='coerce').dropna()
population_2009 = pd.to_numeric(data['2009'], errors='coerce').dropna()

# Step 4: Create the eCDF plots using Seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot eCDF for 1995
sns.ecdfplot(population_1995, label='1995', color='skyblue', linewidth=2)

# Plot eCDF for 2009
sns.ecdfplot(population_2009, label='2009', color='salmon', linewidth=2)

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (eCDF) of State Populations (Excluding D.C.)')
plt.xlabel('Population In Thousands')
plt.ylabel('ECDF')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

- Explanation
  
  ```
  1) This code effectively visualizes the cumulative distribution of state populations for the years 1995 and 2009 using eCDF plots.

  2) The eCDF shows a clear comparisons of population distributions over time and provides insights into how the population landscape of the states has evolved, all while excluding Washington,
     D.C. for the years 1995 and 2009
  3) X-Axis (Population In Thousands) represents the population size of states while Y-Axis (ECDF), represents the cumulative proportion of states that have populations less than or equal to the values on the x-axis.
  
  ```
  - *Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of distribution chart idiom for showing these distributions (talk specifically about these distributions, not just their advantages and disadvantages in general)*
- Answer:
```
Advantages:

1) This eCDF plot shows the cumulative proportion of states with populations below a certain value, making it easy to understand the distribution of populations at a glance.

2) By displaying eCDFs for both 1995 and 2009, the plot allows for straightforward comparisons between the two years, helping to highlight changes in population distributions over time.

Disadvantages:

1) While this eCDFs provide cumulative proportions, it does not show individual data points or the specific number of states within certain population ranges. This can mask important details about the data distribution.

2) This eCDFs does convey information about the spread or variability of the data within each population range, unlike histograms or boxplots.

```

- *Name 1-2 simple observations you can draw from each chart*
- Answer:
  1) I observed that about 90% of the states in both 1995 and 2009 are have a population of 15 million or less people. 
  2) I observed that this is a rightly skewed distribution. A right-skewed distribution often indicates the presence of outliers or extreme values on the high end of the scale.
     


## PART 2 : FURTHER ANALYSIS

###### From the first Boxplot it show some outliers I wanted to answer the following question:
###### 1) What states population were the outliers 1970, 1985, 1995 and 2009.
###### 2) Are the same states consistently outliers in each of those years and why were they outliers in those year or not 




























Idiom: STACKED BAR CHART / Mark: Bar
| Data: Attribute | Data: Attribute Type  | Encode: Channel | 
| --- |---| --- |
| Water | value, quantitative| vertical position on a common scale (y-axis, top portion of bar) (y-axis) |
| Land | value, quantitative| vertical position on a common scale (y-axis, bottom portion of bar) |
| States | key, categorical | outer horizontal spatial region  (x-axis) |

- *Explanation of how the idiom used in your chart is appropriate for your datasets and question/task*
- Answer: I used a stacked bar chart to show the fraction of water and land in the total area
- *Discussion of any insights gained about the data from your chart*
- I found that Alaska has the largest water to proportion
- *Discussion of any design decisions you made*
- I selected the top 10 largest states in the US
- *Discussion of any special customizations you used*
- I added labels to the bars, to visualize the actual values
- *Further Questions - What further questions does your exploration of the dataset prompt? What hypotheses do you have about what the answers might be? Are there other tables that might help you address these questions?*
- I would to know how many states will I sum to get the size of Alaska, I think about 5 of the top 10 states. Yes, there is a table to help address this question. I would also love to know where Alaska would rank by population from the top 10 states. 






### Q3 Combine this table with Table 12 (Resident Population, from Section 1 - Population) to show the relationship between land area and 2008 population for each state.

- *Explanation of how the idiom used in your chart is appropriate for your datasets and question/task*
- Answer: I used a stacked bar chart to show the fraction of population and land in the area
- *Discussion of any insights gained about the data from your chart*
- I found some states whose population is significantly smaller compared to its land area. 
- *Discussion of any design decisions you made*
- I decided to use a log scale so I can visualize the population ratios, a linear scale gave me poor results. 
- *Discussion of any special customizations you used*
- I added labels to the bar whose population hue did not show because of how small it is. 
- *Further Questions - What further questions does your exploration of the dataset prompt? What hypotheses do you have about what the answers might be? Are there other tables that might help you address these questions?*
- I would to know for those states which significantly smaller population compare to their land size, why less people live there despite how large the are. Hypothesis could be that they have less opportunities. I do not have a table to address this question.

- *Discussion of any insights gained about the data from your chart*
- I found that mining,  aquaculture and Commercial did not significantly increase over time. I also found that irrigation use is begining to decline
- *Discussion of any design decisions you made*
- I used distinct colors to represent each end use  
- *Discussion of any special customizations you used*
- no special customizations bacause the multi-line chart is clear
- *Further Questions - What further questions does your exploration of the dataset prompt? What hypotheses do you have about what the answers might be? Are there other tables that might help you address these questions?*
- I would love to know why the sharp increase from 1950 to 1980 in themo-electric power and sudden decline and plateau from 1980. I would also like to know what is causing the decline in irrigation.

### Q6: Combine this table with Table 354 (Land Cover/Use by Type) to show the relationship between the change in area of cropland and pastureland to rural water withdrawal (domestic and livestock).

- *Explanation of how the idiom used in your chart is appropriate for your datasets and question/task*
- Answer: I used a multi-line chart to show the change of Cropland, Pastureland and Rural Water Withdrawals over the years 
- *Discussion of any insights gained about the data from your chart*
- I found that Rural water withdrawal is holding steady over the years I selected.
- *Discussion of any design decisions you made*
- Firstly from the table 358 there were no data of year 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2003. I had to interlopate to get values of those specific years from the existing values. With the values of I got, I combined it with table 354, which had cropland and pastureland water values for those specific years. 
- *Discussion of any special customizations you used*
- I used distinct colors to represent the various water uses.
- *Further Questions - What further questions does your exploration of the dataset prompt? What hypotheses do you have about what the answers might be? Are there other tables that might help you address these questions?*
- I would like to know if the cropland water withdrawal is holding steady or still declining till date. My hypothesis is that it is still holding steady. I have no tables to address this question.

### Q7 Choose 5 cities and compare their record highs in each month. You may pick the 5 cities however you wish, but you must discuss how you chose the cities.

#### ANSWER: I selected 5 cities from the various regions of  the united states namely: Los Angeles: West, Mobile: South, Chicago: Midwest, Little Rock: South, Denver: Mountain.

- *Explanation of how the idiom used in your chart is appropriate for your datasets and question/task*
- Answer: I used a multi-line chart to show the monthly record high temperatures
- *Discussion of any insights gained about the data from your chart*
- From the Month of July to August, only Mobile and Los Angeles are trending upwards. 
- *Discussion of any design decisions you made*
- I used distinct colors to represent each city chosen
- *Discussion of any special customizations you used*
- no special customizations.

- I noticed that from August to Septempter only Los Angeles is trending upwards, I would like to see if there are other cities with this behaviour. My hypothesis is yes, escpecially in the west. There are tables to address this question.

### Q8 Using the data from all of the cities, which month most often has the highest high? (Hint: For each month, show the number of times it had the highest high for a city.)

### ANSWER IS JULY

- *Explanation of how the idiom used in your chart is appropriate for your datasets and question/task*
- Answer: I used a Bar chart because it best shows frequency with the height of the bars.
- *Discussion of any insights gained about the data from your chart*
- I found the months of July and August had the the same frequecy of highest temperatures
- *Discussion of any design decisions you made*
- I decided to give each Bar a unique color to represent the months
- *Discussion of any special customizations you used*
- I added the frequency as a label to the bars 
- *Further Questions - What further questions does your exploration of the dataset prompt? What hypotheses do you have about what the answers might be? Are there other tables that might help you address these questions?*
- I would like to know if the frequency of highest temperatures have changed over the years. My Hypothesis is yes, because of climate change. I do not have a table to address this questions but there could be. 

### Q8 Combine this table with Table 380 (Lowest Temperature of Record) to show the relationship between each city's annual highest high and annual lowest low.

- *Explanation of how the idiom used in your chart is appropriate for your datasets and question/task*
- Answer: I used a Horizontal Bar chart so I could visual encode the temperature by the length of the Bar
- *Discussion of any insights gained about the data from your chart*
- I found that Phoenix had the highest temperature and Bismarck had the lowest temperature
- *Discussion of any design decisions you made*
- I decided not to give all the cities unique colors, it would too colorful and confusing. 
- *Discussion of any special customizations you used*
- I decided to popout the highest and lowest temperatures 
- *Further Questions - What further questions does your exploration of the dataset prompt? What hypotheses do you have about what the answers might be? Are there other tables that might help you address these questions?*
- I would like to know, over the years if more cities are having lower minimun temperatures and higher maximum temperatures. I want to know where the trend lies, my hypothesis is yes, and there could be data to address this question.
